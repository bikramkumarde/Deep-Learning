# Deep-Learning
Assignments arer various code files with neural networks developed from scratch without using Keras or TensorFlow models.
1. The Neural_Utils.py is a python files conatining necessary functions which needs to be kept in the same folder as the jupyter notebooks.
2. The data_breast_cancer.csv contains the breast cancer data in csv format. It needs to be in the same folder as the jupyter notebook. The data can be obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data
3. The feed forward Neural Network is a jupyter notebook where the network is built from scratch.
4. The Feed forward Keras is a jupyter notebok which uses keras model for neural network.
5. The attached project report is a pdf file containing the final report.
